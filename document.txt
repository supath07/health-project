idea--
-->>-- pull User profile from users table...
    -- age, health conditions
    -- saved location
-->>-- environmental datA(via apis)
    -- temperature, humidity, UV index
    -- air quality (PM2.5, PM10, AQI)
    -- Pollen forecast via open meteo
-->>-- pull Health logs from health_logs table
    -- symptoms like asthma, hay fever, headaches?..

logic--
== Rule-based engine
-- IF temp > 30C- the web will show heatwave advice card
-- IF AQI > 100- it will show air quality warning card
-- IF symptom=asthma and AQI > 50 -> show asthma-specific advice 
-- IF pollen is high and symptom = hay fever-> show allergy management time_stamp

page layout would be like this---
--> hero section-- personalised health advice
--> stats panel-- show today's weather + aqi for their location
--> advice cards-- Each card will have one piece of advice with icon + short TEXT
--> optional cta-- log a symptom -- then send 'em to dashboard

Icons for each advice type 
save advice to dashboard


->> 7-dashboard.php 
idea-- 

-->>-- environmental data = weather + air quality from apis 
-->>-- user data = location, health logs ,and  profile info 
-->>-- actionable insights like summaries alerts and trends 

-->>-- user profile - their name for greeting
                    - saved location 
-->>-- environmental data - current AQI, PM2.5, PM10 
                          - current temperature & humidity 
                          - or add 3 days forecast summary 
-->>-- user health logs - recent symptoms 
                        - maybe add some notes as well 

logic--

== Air quality alerts 
- IF aqi > 100 -> unhealthy air, limit outdoor activity
- IF aqi > 50 and user has asthma logs -> asthma risk alert 

== Weather alerts 
- IF temp > 30 -> Heat stress warning 
- IF temp < 5 -> Cold stress warning 

== Health log insights 
- Show last 5 logs 
- highlight correlations like 'you logged hay feveer on 3 high pollen days' 

page layout would be like this--- 
--> a welcome banner- like, hello, user- here's your health snapshot 
--> Location panel- show saved city?.... option to update or auto-locate 
--> air quality card- AQI, PM2.5, PM10 with color-coded severity 
--> weather card: current temp, humidity, feels-like 
--> health-logs card- quick add form 
-- advice summary-- pull in rules from 2-advice.php to show "today's key advice"
